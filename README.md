VERY BASIC AND USELESS APP I MADE FOR FUN
VERY LITTLE (TO NO) TESTING HAS BEEN DONE



Double click on app to begin

It will keep sending notifications until the button on notification is clicked

This button will take the user to amazon to buy bottled water

App will then wait 1 hour before sending notifications again

This will continue until the app is turned off

The app can only be turned off via task manager (as of right now)

Good luck
